# TASK

"""

It’s your first day as a data engineer, and you’ve been assigned a simple task. 
AltSchool Africa has a pipeline that processes Student School Fees Infromation. 
Alt school payment partners sends these information in three different formats, 
XML, JSON, and YAML/YML. Write a simple python script that ensures only accepted 
file formats pass through the pipeline.
